# FixItUp â€” campus marketplace (demo)

This is a minimal Next.js demo for the FixItUp project: a campus-centric marketplace for repairs, reuse and recycling.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd d:\\FixItUp
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- This demo uses a file-backed JSON store in `data/` for simplicity.
- Image uploads are stored as base64 in the JSON (demo only); swap to Cloudinary or Firebase Storage for production.
